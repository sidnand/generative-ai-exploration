    <h2>Theme: <em>AI Taking Over the Human Race</em></h2>

    <div id="images">
        <img src="./img/1.png" alt="AI generated image 1">
        <img src="./img/2.png" alt="AI generated image 2">

    <h2>Process</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Go to <a href="https://starryai.com/app/my-creations">starryai</a></li>
        <li>Click on the <em>Create</em> button</li>
        <li>The prompt is: <br> <em>Image depicting an abstract idea of artificial intelligence systems ruling over the human race.</em></li>
        <li>Set the style to <em>Abstract World</em></li>
        <li>Click on the <em>Generate</em> button</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Positives of the AI Generation Tool</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Generates images very quickly.</li>
        <li>Able to depict a dystopian world.</li>
        <li>Visual is artistic and gives the correct emotional impressions to the viewer. The image is dystopian, futuristic, and negative-looking.</li>
        <li>From far away, it seems like a human artist created these. It doesn't seem artificially produced.</li>
        <li>I like that the tool gives you many style options.</li>
        <li>The tool also gave a prompt generator, which is a nice feature because it allows this tool to be more exploratory and gives people more ideas about what kinds of prompts to use.</li>
        <li>This tool allows you to publish and share your creations with others on this platform, which a nice idea because helps creates inspiration.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Negatives of the AI Generation Tool</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>In the 3rd image, the reflection on the water seems off. The reflection looks like trees on a hill, but that's not what it should be reflecting.</li>
        <li>There seems to be a lack of diversity because all the images produce a bunch of big robots.</li>
        <li>The images lack details in terms of the objects they show. There seems to be one main object and other objects, but those are either too small to identify or blurry. For example, the human image in 3. It looks like it is either standing or riding a bike. The car in that image is also blurry, and parts of the car are not rendered, like the wheels.</li>
        <li>This tool only gives you 4 free credits at the beginning and 3 credits every 3 days. If you need more, you'll need to pay.</li>
        <li>Can't tweak the image after it is created using this tool. This is a big issue because sometimes the prompts won't give the image you were hoping for, so your left with just continuously tweaking the prompt.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Impacts of AI Generative Tools</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Artistic Innovation:</strong> Generative tools will continue to push the boundaries of artistic expression. Artists and creators will increasingly leverage these tools to produce unique and novel artworks, influencing visual arts, music, literature, and other creative disciplines.</li>

        <li><strong>Enhanced Human-Computer Interaction:</strong> As generative tools become more sophisticated, they will enhance human-computer interaction. Natural language processing combined with generative capabilities will lead to more intuitive and personalized user experiences in applications ranging from virtual assistants to customer support chatbots.</li>

        <li><strong>Scientific Discovery and Exploration:</strong> In fields like biology and chemistry, generative models can be applied to simulate and explore molecular structures, potentially accelerating drug discovery and scientific research. These tools may contribute to breakthroughs in understanding complex systems.</li>

        <li><strong>Ethical Considerations:</strong> The use of generative tools will raise ethical concerns related to deepfakes, misinformation, and the potential for malicious use. Society will need to develop frameworks and regulations to address these challenges and ensure responsible use.</li>

        <li><strong>Education and Training:</strong> Generative tools will find applications in education, enabling interactive and personalized learning experiences. These tools can assist in creating simulations, educational content, and adaptive learning environments.</li>
    </ul>
